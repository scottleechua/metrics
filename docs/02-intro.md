## Questions econometrics can answer
- Descriptive (correlations, summary statistics)
- Predictive (using a trained model)
- Causal (lab or natural experiment)

## Data used
- Cross-sectional
    - Many data points collected per cross-sectional unit at one point in time
- Time series
    - Change in variable over time
- Pooled cross-section
    - "Before and after": 2 sets of cross-sectional units
    - Units measured "before" need not be the same as units measured "after"
- Panel/longitudinal
    - Time series per cross-sectional unit
    - Units the same at multiple points in time
    - Can establish causality
