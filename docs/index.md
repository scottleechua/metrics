# Overview

These are lecture notes for an introductory undergraduate econometrics class. They are based off my notes for YSS2211 Econometrics at Yale-NUS College, as taught by [Eugene Choo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E0B6j9AAAAAJ&hl=en).

I first made these notes for myself while taking the class, then refined them over the next three years while serving as economics peer tutor.

**This is a work in progress.** The plan is to license these notes under Creative Commons, but as I have not yet thought that through, all rights are reserved for the time being.
