# Probability

The probability of event $E$, $\mathbb{P} (E)$, is defined as
\[
\lim{N \to \infty} \frac{\text{number of occurrences of }E}{N},
\]
where $N$ is the number of independent trials.

## 5 rules of probability
1. $0 \leq \mathbb{P}(E) \leq 1.$
2. $\mathbb{P} (\emptyset) = 0.$
3. $\mathbb{P} (\Omega) = 1$, where $\Omega$ is the whole sample space.
4. If $E$ is a disjoint union of events $E_1, \ldots, E_k$, then
\[
\mathbb{P}E = \sum_{i = 1}^k \mathbb{P}E_i.
\]
5. Bayes' rule

## Independence
If $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A) \mathbb{P}(B)$ or $\mathbb{P}(A\vert B) = \mathbb{P}(A)$, then $A$ and $B$ are independent.
